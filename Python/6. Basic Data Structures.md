## 6. Python Basic Data Structures and Access Methods:

## 1. Lists:
   - Definition: Lists are ordered collections of items, which can be of any data type. They are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation.
   - Access Methods:
     - Indexing: Access individual elements using their index. Indexing starts from 0 for the first element.
       ```python
       my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
       print(my_list[2])  # Output: 3
       ```
     - Slicing: Extract a portion of the list using slicing notation `start:stop:step`. This returns a new list.
       ```python
       my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
       ```
     - Negative Indexing: Access elements from the end of the list using negative indices.
       ```python
       my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 5
       ```
     - List Methods: Python provides many built-in methods to manipulate lists such as `append()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, etc.
       ```python
       my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       my_list.append(6)  # Adds 6 to the end of the list
       my_list.insert(2, 7)  # Inserts 7 at index 2
       my_list.pop()  # Removes and returns the last element
       my_list.remove(3)  # Removes the first occurrence of 3
       my_list.sort()  # Sorts the list in ascending order
       ```

## 2. Tuples:
   - Definition: Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
   - Access Methods:
     - Indexing: Same as lists, access elements using their indices.
       ```python
       my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
       print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
       ```
     - Slicing: Similar to lists, extract a portion of the tuple using slicing notation.
       ```python
       my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
       print(my_tuple[1:4])  # Output: (2, 3, 4)
       ```

## 3. Dictionaries:
   - Definition: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are mutable and indexed by unique keys.
   - Access Methods:
     - Access by Key: Access values using their corresponding keys.
       ```python
       my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
       print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: John
       ```
     - Dictionary Methods: Python provides methods such as `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, etc., to access keys, values, and key-value pairs.
       ```python
       my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
       print(my_dict.keys())  # Output: dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'city'])
       ```

## 4. Sets:
   - Definition: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are mutable but do not support duplicate elements.
   - Access Methods:
     - Access by Element: Check if an element exists in the set using the `in` keyword.
       ```python
       my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
       print(3 in my_set)  # Output: True
       ```
     - Set Methods: Python provides methods such as `add()`, `remove()`, `union()`, `intersection()`, etc., for set operations.
       ```python
       my_set = {1, 2, 3}
       my_set.add(4)  # Adds 4 to the set
       my_set.remove(2)  # Removes 2 from the set
       ```
## 5. Strings:
   - Definition: Strings are immutable sequences of characters. They can be accessed and manipulated using various methods.
   - Access Methods:
     - Indexing: Access individual characters using their indices.
       ```python
       my_string = "Hello"
       print(my_string[0])  # Output: H
       ```
     - Slicing: Extract substrings using slicing notation.
       ```python
       my_string = "Hello"
       print(my_string[1:3])  # Output: el
       ```
     - String Methods: Python provides numerous methods to manipulate strings such as `upper()`, `lower()`, `split()`, `join()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, etc.
       ```python
       my_string = "Hello, world"
       print(my_string.upper())  # Output: HELLO, WORLD
       ```

## 6. Arrays:
   - Definition: Arrays in Python are data structures used to store collections of elements. Unlike lists, arrays can only store elements of the same data type. Arrays are created using the `array` module.
   - Access Methods:
       1. Indexing: Access individual elements using their indices.
          ```python
          from array import array
          arr = array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
          print(arr[0])  # Output: 1
          ```
      
      3. Slicing: Extract portions of arrays using slicing notation.
         ```python
         from array import array
      
         arr = array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
         print(arr[1:3])  # Output: array('i', [2, 3])
         ```
      
      4. Negative Indexing: Access elements from the end of arrays using negative indices.
         ```python
         from array import array
      
         arr = array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
         print(arr[-1])  # Output: 5
         ```
      
      5. Methods: Use built-in methods such as `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, etc., to manipulate arrays.
         ```python
         from array import array
      
         arr = array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
         arr.append(6)
         print(arr)  # Output: array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
         ```

## QUESTION TIME:

**Question 1:** What is the difference between lists and tuples in Python?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
The main difference between lists and tuples in Python is mutability. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation, while tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Additionally, lists are denoted by square brackets `[ ]`, whereas tuples are denoted by parentheses `( )`.

**Answer:**
```python
def count_characters(string):
    char_freq = {}
    for char in string:
        if char in char_freq:
            char_freq[char] += 1
        else:
            char_freq[char] = 1
    return char_freq

string = "hello"
print(count_characters(string))  # Output: {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}
```
</details>

**Question 3:** What is the purpose of using sets in Python?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
Sets in Python are used to store unique elements. They are particularly useful when dealing with tasks that require unique elements or need to perform set operations such as union, intersection, difference, etc. Sets also provide efficient membership testing using the `in` keyword.

**Question 4:** Write a Python function to remove duplicates from a list.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
```python
def remove_duplicates(lst):
    return list(set(lst))

my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
print(remove_duplicates(my_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
</details>

**Question 5:** Explain the difference between the `remove()` and `discard()` methods in Python sets.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
The `remove()` method in Python sets removes a specified element from the set. If the element is not present in the set, it raises a `KeyError`. On the other hand, the `discard()` method also removes a specified element from the set, but it does not raise any error if the element is not present.
