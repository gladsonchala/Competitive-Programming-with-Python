# 10. Loops/Iterations

In programming, `Loops/Iteration` involves repeating a section of code. The fundamental constructs for iteration are "for" and "while" loops, enabling the execution of code repeatedly based on specific conditions.

## for Loop

The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or any other iterable object.

**Explanation:**
The `for` loop iterates over each item in a sequence or iterable object and executes a block of code for each iteration.

**Syntax:**
```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code block to execute
```

**Example:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

---

## while Loop

The `while` loop in Python is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

**Explanation:**
The `while` loop continues to execute the block of code until the specified condition becomes false.

**Syntax:**
```python
while condition:
    # Code block to execute
```

**Example:**
```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

---

## break Statement

The `break` statement in Python is used to exit the loop prematurely, regardless of whether the loop condition has been met or not.

**Explanation:**
When encountered, the `break` statement immediately terminates the loop it is in and transfers control to the next statement after the loop.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

---

## continue Statement

The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.

**Explanation:**
When encountered, the `continue` statement skips the remaining code in the loop's block and proceeds to the next iteration.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

---

## range() Function

The `range()` function in Python is used to generate a sequence of numbers.

**Explanation:**
The `range()` function creates a sequence of numbers according to the specified parameters, which can be used in loops or other operations.

**Syntax:**
```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

---

## enumerate() Function

The `enumerate()` function in Python is used to loop over an iterable object while keeping track of the index.

**Explanation:**
The `enumerate()` function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object, which can be used in loops.

**Syntax:**
```python
for index, value in enumerate(iterable):
    # Code block to execute
```

**Example:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)
```

---

## Nested Loops

Nested loops in Python refer to loops inside another loop.

**Explanation:**
Nested loops are useful for iterating over multiple sequences or performing repetitive tasks within a loop.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)
```

---

## zip() Function

The `zip()` function in Python is used to combine multiple iterables into a single iterable.

**Explanation:**
The `zip()` function returns an iterator that produces tuples where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables.

**Example:**
```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]
for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(name, age)
```

---

## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists.

**Explanation:**
List comprehensions allow you to create lists based on existing lists or other iterables, with a compact syntax.

**Syntax:**
```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

**Example:**
```python
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)
```

---

## sorted() Function

The `sorted()` function in Python is used to sort elements of an iterable.

**Explanation:**
The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable.

**Syntax:**
```python
sorted(iterable, key=key, reverse=reverse)
```

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 2]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)
```

---

## filter() Function

The `filter()` function in Python is used to filter elements of an iterable based on a function.

**Explanation:**
The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from elements of the iterable for which the function returns `True`.

**Syntax:**
```python
filter(function, iterable)
```

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)
```

---

## map() Function

The `map()` function in Python is used to apply a function to all elements of an iterable.

**Explanation:**
The `map()` function returns an iterator that applies the specified function to each item of the iterable.

**Syntax:**
```python
map(function, iterable)
```

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)
```

---

## reversed() Function

The `reversed()` function in Python is used to reverse the elements of an iterable.

**Explanation:**
The `reversed()` function returns an iterator that yields the elements of the iterable in reverse order.

**Syntax:**
```python
reversed(iterable)
```

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_numbers = list(reversed(numbers))
print(reversed_numbers)
```

## Custom Iterators [ADVANCED Concept]

Custom iterators in Python allow you to define your own iteration behavior for objects.

**Explanation:**
By implementing the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods, you can create objects that can be iterated over using the `for` loop or other iteration constructs.

**Example:**
```python
class MyIterator:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = len(data)

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.index == 0:
            raise StopIteration
        self.index -= 1
        return self.data[self.index]

iterable = MyIterator([1, 2, 3])
for item in iterable:
    print(item)
```
