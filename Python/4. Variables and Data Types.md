# 4. Variables & Data Types

## Variables

Variables in Python are used to store data values. They act as placeholders for various types of data.

Example:
```python
x = 5
name = "John"
```
In the example above, `x` and `name` are variables. `x` stores the integer value `5`, while `name` stores the string value `"John"`.

## Data Types

### Integers

Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.

Examples:
- `10`
- `42`
- `-7`

### Floats

Floats (floating-point numbers) are numbers with a decimal point or use an exponential (e) to represent numbers.

Examples:
- `3.14`
- `2.5`
- `-0.003`

### Strings

Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed within single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

Examples:
- `"Hello"`
- `'Python'`
- `"123"`

### Booleans

Booleans represent truth values `True` or `False`.

Examples:
- `True`
- `False`


## QUESTION TIME:


**1. How do you swap the values of two variables in Python without using a third variable?**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
To swap the values of two variables `a` and `b` without using a third variable, you can use Python's tuple packing and unpacking feature:

```python
a = 5
b = 10

a, b = b, a

print("a:", a)  # Output: 10
print("b:", b)  # Output: 5
```

This works because the right-hand side is evaluated first, creating a temporary tuple `(b, a)`, and then the values are unpacked into `a` and `b`.

**2. What is the output of the following code?**

```python
x = 10
y = 5
z = x + y
print(z)
```

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
The output of the code is:

```
15
```

Explanation: The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values `10` and `5` respectively. Then, `z` is assigned the sum of `x` and `y`, which is `10 + 5 = 15`. Finally, the value of `z` is printed, resulting in `15`.

**3. What does the type() function return in Python?**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
The `type()` function in Python returns the type of the object passed to it.

Example:
```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

y = "Hello"
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'str'>

z = [1, 2, 3]
print(type(z))  # Output: <class 'list'>
```

The function returns the class or type of the object, which can be used for type checking or introspection in Python programs.

**4. How do you convert a string to an integer in Python?**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
To convert a string to an integer in Python, you can use the `int()` function.

Example:
```python
string_number = "123"
integer_number = int(string_number)
print(integer_number)  # Output: 123
```

If the string represents an invalid integer, such as `"abc"`, a `ValueError` will be raised.

**5. What is the difference between using single quotes and double quotes to define a string in Python?**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
In Python, there is no functional difference between using single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) to define a string. Both can be used interchangeably. However, if the string itself contains single quotes, it's often convenient to define the string using double quotes, and vice versa, to avoid escaping characters.

Example:
```python
single_quoted = 'She said, "Hello!"'
double_quoted = "He replied, 'Hi!'"
```

**6. What is the difference between an integer and a floating-point number, and when would you choose one over the other for representing numeric data in your Python program?**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
- **Difference:** 
  - Integers are whole numbers without any decimal points, while floating-point numbers (floats) include decimal points or use an exponential (e) to represent numbers.
  - Integers are typically used for counting or representing discrete quantities, while floats are used for continuous quantities or when precision is required in mathematical calculations.
- **When to choose:**
  - Use integers when dealing with whole numbers or when precision after the decimal point is not required.
  - Use floating-point numbers when dealing with fractions, measurements, or any situation where precision after the decimal point is necessary.

Example:
```python
# Integer representing the number of items
quantity = 10

# Float representing a measurement
temperature = 25.5
```

**7. Given two integers `a` and `b`, swap their values without using a temporary variable.**

<details>

**Answer:**
```python
a = a + b
b = a - b
a = a - b
```

**8. What is the correct way to declare a global variable in Python?**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
To declare a global variable in Python, you can use the `global` keyword inside a function to indicate that a variable is defined in the global scope.

Example:
```python
x = 10

def my_function():
    global y
    y = 20

my_function()
print(y)  # Output: 20
```

In this example, the `global` keyword inside the `my_function` function indicates that `y` is a global variable, even though it's assigned a value within the function.

**9. What does the following Python code print?**

```python
x = 10
y = 20
x, y = y, x
print(x)
```

**10. What is type inference in Python? and how it works.**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

**Answer:**
Type inference in Python refers to the ability of the Python interpreter to automatically determine the data type of a variable based on the value assigned to it. Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables do not have fixed types and their types are determined at runtime.

Example:
```python
x = 10  # x is inferred to be an integer
y = "Hello"  # y is inferred to be a string
```

Type inference works by analyzing the value assigned to a variable and assigning an appropriate data type accordingly. This allows for flexible and concise code, as programmers do not need to explicitly declare the data type of variables.
