**Useful Tip: Utilizing `//` for Integer Division**:

In the context of the examples provided, the use of `//` serves the purpose of integer division. Here are some tips and tricks for leveraging `//` in competitive programming challenges:

1. **Integer Division**: The `//` operator performs division where the result is rounded down to the nearest integer, discarding any fractional part.
   ```python
   result = 7 // 2  # This will give 3, not 3.5
   ```

2. **Extracting Digits**: In the context of extracting digits from a number, `n //= 10` is used to remove the last digit in each iteration of a loop.
   ```python
   n = 12345
   while n > 0:
       digit = n % 10  # Extract last digit
       n //= 10         # Remove last digit
   ```

3. **Finding the Quotient**: When dealing with division where only the integer part of the result is needed, `//` is preferred over `/`.
   ```python
   quotient = 17 // 3  # This will give 5
   ```

4. **Dealing with Negative Numbers**: `//` follows the behavior of rounding towards negative infinity for negative operands.
   ```python
   result = -7 // 2  # This will give -4, not -3.5
   ```

5. **Splitting into Groups**: Use `//` to divide a sequence into equal-sized groups or partitions.
   ```python
   items_per_group = 5
   total_items = 23
   num_groups = (total_items + items_per_group - 1) // items_per_group
   ```

6. **Flooring Decimal Numbers**: While `math.floor()` provides similar functionality, `//` is often faster for integer division.
   ```python
   import math
   result1 = math.floor(7.5)  # This will give 7
   result2 = 7.5 // 1         # This will give 7
   ```

7. **Avoiding Floating Point Errors**: In cases where floating-point errors may occur, `//` ensures precise integer division without rounding errors.
   ```python
   result = 10**10 // 3.0  # This will give precise integer result without rounding errors
   ```

By understanding and utilizing `//` effectively, you can achieve efficient and accurate integer division in various competitive programming scenarios.
